# Simple-Pendulum-Pairs-Project
#Included in these supplemetary materials are derivations and elucidations mentioned in the report. We include: a solution to the given ODE; a numerical expansion of it and; a derivation of the potential energy from an analytical expression of time period derived from the Lagrangian. 
We have also included code for each figure bar the pendulum diagram.
