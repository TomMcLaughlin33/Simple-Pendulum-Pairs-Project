# Simple-Pendulum-Pairs-Project
Included in these supplemetary materials are derivations and elucidations mentioned in the report. We include: a solution to the given ODE; a numerical expansion of it and; a derivation of the potential energy from an analytical expression of time period derived from the Lagrangian. 
We have also included code for each figure bar the pendulum diagram.

Just in case, here are links to the replits for the different figures:
